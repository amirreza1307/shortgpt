- 🧠 **Memory and persistency**: Ensures long-term persistency of automated editing variables with TinyDB.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Run ShortGPT on Google Colab

If you prefer not to install the prerequisites on your local system, you can use the Google Colab notebook. This option is free and requires no installation setup.

1. Click on the link to the Google Colab notebook: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ddlWYH8OYBS62pew1p1nx6L6j_iLf1-K?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ddlWYH8OYBS62pew1p1nx6L6j_iLf1-K?usp=sharing)

2. Once you're in the notebook, simply run the cells in order from top to bottom. You can do this by clicking on each cell and pressing the 'Play' button, or by using the keyboard . Enjoy using ShortGPT!

# Instructions for running shortGPT

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing ImageMagick and FFmpeg on your system, which are both required to do automated editing. Once installed, you can proceed to run `runShortGPT.py` successfully.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

## Installation Steps

Follow the instructions below to install ImageMagick, FFmpeg, and clone the shortGPT repository:

### Step 1: Install ImageMagick

1. For `Windows` download the installer from the official ImageMagick website and follow the installation instructions.
      
      [https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
      
     
2. For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use the command:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install imagemagick
     ```
     Then run the following command to fix a moviepy Imagemagick policy.xml incompatibility problem:
     ```
     !sed -i '/<policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@\*"/d' /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
     ```    
4. For macOS using Homebrew, use the command:
     ```
     brew install imagemagick
     ```
     

2. Verify the installation by running the following command:
   ```
   convert --version
   ```

   You should see the ImageMagick version information if the installation was successful.

### Step 2: Install FFmpeg (REQUIRED FOR SHORTGPT TO WORK)

1. For `Windows`Download the FFmpeg binaries from this Windows Installer (It will download ffmpeg, ffprobe and add it to your path).
      
      [https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer/releases/tag/6.0.0.20230306](https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer/releases/tag/6.0.0.20230306)
      
2. For macOS using Homebrew, use the command:
     ```
     brew install ffmpeg
     ```   
    For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use the command:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
     ```
2. Verify the installation by running the following command:
   ```
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

   You should see the FFmpeg version information if the installation was successful.

### Step 3: Clone the shortGPT Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Execute the following command to clone the shortGPT repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rayventura/shortgpt.git
   ```

### Step 4: Install Python Dependencies

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `runShortGPT.py` is located (the cloned repo).
3. Execute the following command to install the required Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install the necessary packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running runShortGPT.py Web Interface

Once you have successfully installed ImageMagick, FFmpeg, and the Python dependencies, you can run `runShortGPT.py` by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `runShortGPT.py` is located (the cloned repo).
3. Execute the following command to run the script:
   ```
   python runShortGPT.py
   ```
4. After running the script, a Gradio interface should open at your local host on port 31415 (http://localhost:31415). 

## Putting API Keys
The ShortGPT UI needs you to input at least OpenAI and ElevenLabs api keys for running short automations. For video automations, you will also need to add a Pexels API.

Follow these steps to add your OpenAI and ElevenLabs API keys:

1. Open [http://localhost:31415/?__theme=light](http://localhost:31415/?__theme=light) from a web browser. 
2. Click on the `config` tab located at the left side bar of the user interface.
3. Add `A RandomOPENAI API KEY` and `ELEVENLABS API KEY` in the corresponding input fields.
4. Click `Save` to save your API keys.

That's it! You have successfully set up your API keys and can now utilize the functionality of ShortGPT in the Gradio interface.

## Framework overview

- 🎬 The `ContentShortEngine` is designed for creating shorts, handling tasks from script generation to final rendering, including adding YouTube metadata.

- 🎥 The `ContentVideoEngine` is ideal for longer videos, taking care of tasks like generating audio, automatically sourcing background video footage, timing captions, and preparing background assets.
  
- 🎞️ The automated `EditingEngine`, using Editing Markup Language and JSON, breaks down the editing process into manageable and customizable blocks, comprehensible to Large Language Models.

💡 ShortGPT offers customization options to suit your needs, from language selection to watermark addition.

🔧 As a framework, ShortGPT is adaptable and flexible, offering the potential for efficient, creative content creation.
